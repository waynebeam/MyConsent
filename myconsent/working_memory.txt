Okay so this is going well.

The input form was tricky. But what we do now is show the choice text as a label for each radio button,
but then the value of the radio button is the display text. This is sent with the POST. The name attached is the
str version of the question. So we set in the dictionary answer+i to the value we get out of post. We look in post
using the str of the question to pull out the display text of their choice. Then in the consent file we can just write
{{answeri}} in the correct place. We are making hard-coded consents, so this part will be hardcoded.

NEXTUP is to write the basic test consent. Maybe then redo the temp question to be a little more realistic. Then I
can run through an entire test case.
